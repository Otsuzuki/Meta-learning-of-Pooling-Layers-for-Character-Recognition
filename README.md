# Meta-learning of Pooling Layers for Character Recognition

Code and meta-parameters corresponding to Meta-learning of Pooling Layers for Character Recognition, found at this arXiv link.
 
# Features
 
We propose a meta-learning framework for pooling layers. In our framework, a parameterized pooling layer is proposed in which the kernel shape and pooling operation are trainable using two parameters, thereby allowing a flexible pooling of the input data as shown in figure (c). 
In figure (a) and (b), the max and average values are calculated for each kernel. Also, all the kernels share the same shape and operation. 
In figure (c), the proposed meta-learned pooling employs different shapes and operations in individual kernels.

# Installation and requirements
 
All experiments were run in a conda environment with python 3.7.4, using pytorch 1.4.0. The conda environment we used is exported in environment.yml.
 
# Simulation of Artificial 1D data
## Generate data
The file ```train.py``` contains the data generation code. You must specify the name of the problem we wish to generate data for. Options are:

* ```Max_1d``` : 1-D data generated by a max pooling layer
* ```Average_1d``` : 1-D data generated by a average pooling layer
* ```Square_1d``` : 1-D data generated by the pooling layer consists of the max pooling for the first half and average pooling for the second half
* ```Max_2d``` : 2-D data generated by a max pooling layer
* ```Average_2d``` : 2-D data generated by a average pooling layer
* ```Square_2d``` : 2-D data generated by the pooling layer consists of the max pooling for the first half and average pooling for the second half
* ```NonSquare_2d```  
  Example:  
```python train.py --problem Half_maxavg```
